Unless you are my age, you probably never saw or heard of punchboard games such as "No Losers".  These punchboards appeared in bars, local family stores, etc.
You had to pay a small amount (as little as a penny) for the privilege of choosing a number on the punchboard.  The number was then punched out using a 
a stylus and the merchant would read the prize key and tell you what you had won.  The prizes were usually items like 5 pieces of candy.

In this web app we will using an image of the punchboard as the primary user interface, but the outcome will be a clue or a validation.  The clues will guide you to your
next destination.  The validation will be that you have successfully arrived at a checkpoint.  The object of the game is to visit all the checkpoints and arrive at the
final destination in the least number of attempts.  The game is similar to sports car rallyes that were so popular in the 1960's.
